Htmlpad.org Real-time Viewing
=============================

This is a Firefox add-on for htmlpad.org that lets you see your changes as you make them.

* Splits the screen between the editor and a live-updating view of the rendered HTML
* Requires Firefox 4
* Doesn't require a browser restart!
* Currently hides the instructions, should put em back somewhere...
